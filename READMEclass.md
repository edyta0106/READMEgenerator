# Professional README Generator

## Description

A README Generator quickly and efficiently creates README files by using a command-line application to generate it. This will allow the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

## Installation

To get started, create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
- THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
- WHEN I enter my project title
- THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
- WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
- THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
- WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
- THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
- WHEN I enter my GitHub username
- THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
- WHEN I enter my email address
- THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
- WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
- THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
